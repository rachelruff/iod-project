Skills Assessments:

Congratulations on making it through the first-round of screening. Your resume was impressive. We'd like to see your coding skills, but we don't believe in white boarding. In fact, did you know that most developers don't write more than 5-6 lines of codes without referencing documentation, Googling, Stack Overflowing etc.? So we don't expect you to do it for us under pressure. Instead, we have a brief assignment for you.

 

Instructions

- Create a simple CRUD application using NodeJS and ReactJS. These two technologies are required. You're welcome to use any other technologies you are comfortable with such as ExpressJS, NextJS, Redux, Hapi etc. to help your application run properly. 

- You do not necessarily have to finish the entire application, so don't spend hours on it. We're happy to look at the code you have after an hour or two.

- Use Bootstrap v4 or another CSS framework for easy and quick CSS.

- When you're done, zip up your code in a single compressed directory and email it back to us. 

- Bonus points if you also get it deployed to a cloud hosting service like Heroku and we can see it working.

- We are mostly looking to see your coding style, coding best practices (refactoring, semantic code, etc.), so imagine another developer is going to pick up your codebase and work on it at a later date. 

 

 

The Application

You're creating an ultra-simplified employee management app. Our application needs to be able to:

 

- add new employees (C)

- view all current employees in a simple table (R)

- update employee details (U)

- delete employees that leave the company (D)

 

For each employee, the HR manager needs to see the following attributes in a simple table:

- employee ID number

- first name

- last name

- email address

- phone number

- salary

 

That's it. Other than that, feel free to get creative.
